# library
It is a library management system. There are two types of users - admins and students. Students can view books, comment and like books but cannot edit or delete them. Also they can't choose a book for collection. Admins have the ability to assign books to students and each student can have multiple books assigned. A student is able to see the books that are assigned to him. In theory, it is an electronic library so one book can be assigned to multiple users. There is admin/register functionality as well as class views.
